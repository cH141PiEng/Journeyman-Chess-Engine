# Journeyman Chess Engine
The Journeyman Chess Engine version 1.8 integrates classic type bitboard move generation from Butter. The evaluation is mostly the same as in Ethereal 9.30. Search and many other parts of the code are from Weiss .10. Compiled using Visual Studio 2019 for Windows. An under development description of how Journeyman version 1.0 works is found in the Mathematica notebook TheJourneymanChessEngine.nb.
