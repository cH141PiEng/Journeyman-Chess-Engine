# Journeyman Chess Engine
The C code of the Journeyman Chess Engine version 2.1 is mostly from Weiss, however it does not use threading in its search. All of the code is in one file. It integrates classic bitboard move generation from Butter. In 2'+1'' blitz its elo is approximately 3000. Compiled using Visual Studio 2019 for 64 bit Windows. An under development description of how Journeyman version 1.0 works is found in the Mathematica notebook TheJourneymanChessEngine.nb.
