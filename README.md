# Journeyman Chess Engine
The Video Instruction Chess Engine corresponding to video #87 here - https://www.chessprogramming.org/Vice - is the basis for this engine. Uses classic bitboards similar to Butter instead of a 120 array. Uses tapered evaluation. Razoring, Reverse futility pruning and LMR as in CeeChess 1.3. Aspiration window as in Weiss 0.6. Has a number of simpler evaluation features done as in Ethereal. Piece square tables from Ethereal 9.30. All of the code is in a single file. Compiled using Visual Studio 2019. An under development description of how it works is found in the Mathematica notebook TheJourneymanChessEngine.nb - so far just for version Journeyman-1.0.
