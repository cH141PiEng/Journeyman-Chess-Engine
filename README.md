# Journeyman Chess Engine
Modified version of the Video Instruction Chess Engine corresponding to video #82. Uses classic bitboards similar to Butter instead of a 120 array. Uses tapered evaluation. Has a number of simpler evaluation features done as in Ethereal. All of the code is in a single file. Compiled using Visual Studio 2019. A description of how it works is found in the Mathematica notebook TheJourneymanChessEngine.nb.
